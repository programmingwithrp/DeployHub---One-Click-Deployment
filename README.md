## Services

### Upload Service

The Upload Service is responsible for fetching GitHub URLs from the UI (located in the frontend folder) and uploading them to an S3 bucket. Additionally, it adds the project ID to a Redis queue for further processing.

To start the Upload Service, run the following command:

npm start


### Deploy Service

The Deploy Service handles the deployment process triggered by elements in the Redis queue. It retrieves data from S3, saves it locally, builds it, and uploads the required built files back to S3 in the dist folder.

To start the Deploy Service, run the following command:

npm start


### Request Handler

The Request Handler service manages incoming requests and serves the required content based on custom URLs. It also monitors the status of deployments by fetching data from the queue.
